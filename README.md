# Movify
A web app for film enthusiasts to post their own movies, and for film junkies to discover them.

## Tech Stack:
This was my first project built using the MERN stack. Here is everything used:
- MongoDB
- React.js
- Express.js
- Node.js
- Tailwindcss

## Run the project
Go into terminal and do the following

`git clone https://github.com/RyanHaraki/Movify.git`

`cd Movify & npm install`

Make sure to install the client side dependencies as well

`cd client & yarn add all`

Then, run the client and backend seperately using `node index.js`(or nodemon) for the backend and `yarn start` for the client. Happy hacking!
